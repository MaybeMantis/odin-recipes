    <p>This recipe from the Florida Keys has been given to almost everyone I know. </p>
    <p> It is the best marinade for chicken, and it only takes 30 minutes from prep till you can grill! It's a great blend of flavors with honey, soy sauce, and lime juice.</p>
    <p> If you have time, try marinating overnight for the fullest flavor.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lime juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>4 skinless, bonless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow container, blend soy sauce, honey, vegetable oil, lime juice, and garlic. <p>Place chicken breast halves into the mixture, and turn to coat. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes.</p></li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil the grill grate. Discard marinade, and grill chicken 6 to 8 minutes on each side, until juices run clear.</li>
    </ol>
